# Historical feature archive

This archive retains retired features, earlier migration methods, and experimental approaches that were not adopted. It helps readers using old releases or examining earlier migrations. **Archiving does not mean these features remain available, or that existing migrations must immediately be redone.**

## Reading version notes {#versions}

Current guides describe the 1.9.1 development version. A feature appearing in an older release does not mean its switch still works. The old “re-sign after migration” and “automatically re-sign at login” workflows and limitations remain in the archive. For current behavior, see [settings and permissions](/docs/settings).

See the [changelog](/docs/changelog) for release-by-release changes. If an old migration has problems, preserve your data and backups and follow [macOS 27 upgrade and repair](/docs/macos-27). Do not downgrade or re-sign merely to recreate an old workflow.
