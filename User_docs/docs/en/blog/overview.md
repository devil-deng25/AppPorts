# Blog articles

Some AppPorts decisions came from problems discovered after migrations that appeared successful. These articles connect experiments, failures, and later improvements to explain how those decisions developed.

## Why mount migration, and why APFS? {#mount-and-apfs}

Why can an app fail to read data when its symbolic link still exists? Disk images seem more flexible, so why are they not the default? Follow the tradeoffs from the first access experiments through unplugging, restarting, and validation on real external drives.

## Why some data directories cannot be migrated {#directory-boundaries}

A WeCom startup crash led an investigation from the `tmp` directory into system container checks. Which directories must remain local? Why is a subdirectory not necessarily suitable for migration even when it can be mounted? This article explains the evidence and current limits.

## How to read these articles {#reading}

Articles identify dates, OS and app versions, and distinguish real-app tests, isolated samples, and code inspection. A past success or failure establishes only what happened under those conditions. Current behavior is tied to the code baseline named in each article.

For practical instructions, start with [quick start](/docs/faststart). The six formerly separate experiments are now incorporated into these two articles; use the topic links below to find them. Unfamiliar terms are explained in the [glossary](/docs/glossary).
