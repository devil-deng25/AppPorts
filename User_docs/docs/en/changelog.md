# Changelog

These entries describe changes at the time of each release. **Historical features may have been retired and should not be treated as current instructions.** Current guides describe 2.0.0 (build 50). Older behavior, versions, and alternatives remain in the [historical feature archive](/docs/archive/overview).

## v2.0.0 {#v2-0-0}

These entries describe the code and interface of **2.0.0 build 50**. The version number does not establish availability through download channels.

- Support whole-account or media-only split migration for WeChat, keeping databases and configuration local in split mode. Restore fully before changing modes.
- Support encrypted APFS destinations with an independent password for new data volumes and optional local Keychain storage. Unlock manually without saved credentials.
- Add external-app indexing exclusion and size-cache refresh controls to reduce duplicate search entries and check cache timestamps.
- Add Task Center for apps, app data, tools and custom directories, with background execution inside AppPorts, pause, continue, cancel and history controls. Tasks with conflicting resources wait in the queue.
- Show estimated overall progress across stages and separate preparation, scan, copy, verification, switch and cleanup steps for the current directory. Multi-directory totals no longer stand in for the current stage.
- Distinguish retry, deciding later and keeping old copies. App recovery also offers explicit confirmation for ending an incomplete task or moving back without content verification.
- Add whole-disk ejection: pause automatic mounting before asking Finder to eject, and resume after the device is reconnected.
- Updated native macOS launchers ask users to wait during app-data migration or restoration. Other routes, including directly launching the real app, are outside this protection.
- Destination capability warnings explain app file attributes that cannot be preserved and link to the relevant help page. Ordinary app migration and container mount migration have distinct storage requirements.
- Adjust concurrent reads for data scans and small-file copying while retaining content verification, pre-switch checks and safe cleanup. No fixed speedup is promised across storage devices.
- Continue to separate migration from manual signing, store official originals externally and disable automatic login re-signing on all systems. Complete multilingual prompts for the new interface.

## v1.9.1 (development history) {#v1-9-1}

The following preserves the earlier **1.9.1 build 31** development record. These behaviors continue in 2.0.0:

- App data hides locked, non-migratable structures by default. “Show locked directory structure” reveals their reasons. Status summaries support filtering. Personal-folder shortcuts are identified separately, excluded from app-data sizes, and unavailable for migration.
- Progress distinguishes preparation, copying, verification, and finalization. Reaching 100% copying still requires waiting for the whole operation to finish. Extended inactivity displays the last activity.
- Data migration and manual re-signing are separate; migration no longer automatically signs apps.
- Complete official originals saved before manual signing go automatically to the visible external `AppPorts Backups` folder, with Chinese and English instructions. No new location selection is needed. Without a suitable external drive, signing stops before changing the live app. Internal apps still require temporary internal space.
- Useful older internal originals move externally when conditions permit. Redundant originals and invalid old records are cleaned up according to verification results. Material with recovery value or unclear provenance remains; an offline drive does not mean its backup is lost.
- Signature menus follow status: confirmed re-signed apps retain “Restore Original Signature” and hide duplicate re-signing. Eligible signing actions return after official state is restored.
- Automatic login re-signing is disabled on every macOS version, and its permanent settings card is removed. AppPorts handles the old login task when opened, showing a retry only if cleanup fails.
- Stronger copy validation and container-structure protection recheck data before switching or cleanup.
- Verified originals remain available for recovery. “Signature replaced” and “Signature check pending” are distinguished, with a repair panel for older migrations.
- Fixed re-signing continuing after official-original signature verification failed. Failure or timeout now stops it. Interrupted-signing recovery avoids committing withdrawn operations in the background or re-signing an already completed operation.

## v1.9.0 {#v1-9-0}

- Container data defaults to mount migration: eligible data enters a dedicated unencrypted APFS volume attached at its original directory, preserving the app signature.
- Sandboxed app re-signing is restricted by default. Classic mode requires risk confirmation; older-signature checks, complete backups, and repair entries are provided.
- Added readiness and pre-migration checks explaining permissions, installation location, external format, encryption, and free space.
- Improved remounting after login and drive connection, including actual mount-location checks. Waiting still depends on the drive and system authorization.
- Improved handling of restoration, backup, and cleanup failures, plus the data tree, inline actions, dialogs, localization, and project-support entries.
- Login re-signing was disabled on macOS 27 at that time. 1.9.1 development builds extend this to every system version.

[View v1.9.0](https://github.com/wzh4869/AppPorts/releases/tag/v1.9.0). Its transitional post-migration signing and earlier login tasks are now documented in the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing#versions).

## v1.8.0 {#v1-8-0}

### New features {#v1-8-0-features}

- Custom local scan directories: a “+” beside “Local Apps” adds app locations outside `/Applications`, such as JetBrains Toolbox or Steam installations. Paths persist and file changes are monitored (#48).
- Automatic Stub Portal version synchronization: after an external app updates through the App Store, local portal metadata and the Launch Services cache refresh so “Open With” no longer shows an old version (#50).
- Tool-directory support for Gradle (`~/.gradle`), Android development data (`~/.android`), and Flutter/Dart Pub cache (`~/.pub-cache`) (#49).
- Custom folder migration for projects, models, asset libraries, and tool caches, with relink and restore (#54).
- Protected-app warnings before moving App Store or root-owned apps. They explain possible automatic deletion/replacement permission failures and suggest moving through Finder before creating a link (#55).

### Improvements {#v1-8-0-improvements}

- In-memory caching reduces each app's Info.plist reads from seven to one, improving scan speed.
- A 10-second timeout for codesign subprocesses prevents large signature checks from stalling scans.
- Recursive size calculation stops at 500,000 files to bound traversal of very large bundles such as Electron apps.
- Per-app TRACE logging helps identify scan stalls.
- More precise bundle-ID suffix matching filters generic terms such as app, com, and org, avoiding unrelated system-container scans.
- Tool directories show “Awaiting Relink” when the local path is missing but a managed external directory remains at the standard location. Changing external storage refreshes their state.
- App, data, and custom-folder states, sort/filter labels, switches, and badges follow the selected language more consistently, with clearer accessibility labels.
- Session-level app-size caching reduces repeated “Calculating” states and disappearing sizes after refresh (#55).
- Safer data rollback renames the local source to a hidden backup before linking. Link creation or cleanup failures try to preserve both that backup and the external copy (#54).

### Fixes {#v1-8-0-fixes}

- Fixed extremely slow scans for apps such as Trae, caused by the generic bundle-ID suffix `app` matching many unrelated `~/Library/Containers/` directories.
- Fixed stale Stub Portal versions and “Open With” entries after external App Store updates.
- Fixed refresh not triggering portal-version synchronization.
- Fixed relink/normalization treating an external ordinary file as a directory. Such files are now rejected and preserved.
- Fixed multiline dialogs falling back to Chinese in some languages and completed Russian UI translations. The portal's disconnected-storage dialog also follows the system language (#55).

## v1.7.0 {#v1-7-0}

### New features {#v1-7-0-features}

- “Pending Move Out” identifies a real local app newer than the same-named external app, offering migration of the newer version to replace the older copy.
- Container-data migration confirmation offered optional automatic ad-hoc signing afterward, intended to reduce recognition, storage, and startup issues (#44). **This historical automatic-signing flow is now retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**

### Interface improvements {#v1-7-0-ui}

- More compact icon-and-text toolbar switches for apps and data directories.
- Tool/app-data switching, post-migration signing, original-signature restoration, and refresh were grouped in the top toolbar. **The automatic-signing portion is historical and retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**
- Added the “Pending Move Out” badge to distinguish newer local versions from older external copies.
- Localized migration-signing confirmation titles, text, and buttons. **This automatic-signing flow is retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**

### Improvements {#v1-7-0-improvements}

- Existing external targets are automatically cleaned only when recognized as managed old entries, migration remnants, or when the app is “Pending Move Out.”
- Data recovery no longer relies on similar directory sizes. Automatic relink/recovery requires a full AppPorts metadata match.
- Old scan results no longer replace the selected app's data after rapid app switching.
- Safer administrator-command and AppleScript escaping for quotes, backslashes, spaces, and Chinese characters in Finder deletion and permission repair.
- Completed supported-language translations for help, dialogs, and migration confirmations that previously remained Chinese or incomplete after switching language (#43).

### Fixes {#v1-7-0-fixes}

- Fixed mistaking real external directories for recoverable migration targets.
- Fixed potential deletion of a same-named real external app during migration.
- Fixed unreliable recognition and cleanup of old external portals and migration remnants.
- Fixed malformed AppleScript or administrator commands with special-character paths.
- Fixed background migration or post-migration signing reading the newly selected app after a selection change. **Automatic signing is now retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**
- Fixed the missing “Pending Move Out” badge in app lists.

## v1.6.2 {#v1-6-2}

- Added automatic ad-hoc re-signing of migrated apps with invalid signatures at each login, enabled by default with a settings switch. **This historical feature is now retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**
- Replaced the old bash Stub Portal launcher with a native Mach-O executable to fix opening associated documents by double-clicking in Finder (#42).
- Made About content scrollable to prevent clipping in small windows.
- Fixed native portals being mistaken for ordinary local apps.
- Fixed cleanup of native portals when moving back locally.
- Fixed treating a launcher as a complete app when linking back locally.
- Fixed AutoResignInstaller silently reporting success after installation failure.

## v1.6.1 {#v1-6-1}

- Post-migration signing now targeted the real external app rather than the local Stub Portal. **This automatic-signing flow is now retired; see the [archive](/docs/archive/data-signing).**
- Signing and signature restoration correctly resolved linked apps' real paths.
- Re-signed status detection checked the real external app's signature.
- Added structured error codes and associated paths to logs.
